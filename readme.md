Tourist Guide System

Many a times we go to a new place and find difficulty in finding some necessary places(like atm,hospitals,restaurant etc) this project solves this problem.

It automatically detects user's positions and tells hotels,atm's,department stores etc. in a radius of 5 kilometres.

Also it searches for anything that can be found in a place like we can search(Cake in New York, Shoe shop in San Francisco etc).

It uses Google Places API, Google text search API and Google Maps API.

This code assumes that feedback table is already made with name feedback under database tourist guide.

As this code used google's radius-search feature which is near to deprecation and also due to same origin resource policy you need to enable Cross origin resource sharing for which you might need this extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-toggle/jioikioepegflmdnbocfhgmpmopmjkim
